## Overview

- Create and simulate models of real world component and systems. 
- Start with block diagrams.
- Next steps is simulate using Simulink. 

### Simulink Basics 

- Simulink uses graphical elements to represent the inputs, outputs and calculations within a simulation connections between blocks are made at ports.
- A signal is a piece of information, such as numeric value, which can change over the course of a simulation. Blocks accept signals at input ports, peform an operation ports. Signal lines are visual elements that connect block ports and show where a signal flows: From output ports to input ports, and in the direction of the arrow. 

### Inspecting Signals 

- Reading the value of a signal is an important aspect of understanding and debugging simulations. 

### Obtaining Help

- Documentation for specific blocks can be accessed directly from Simulink. In the Block Parameters dialog (accessible by double-clicking a block), there are two ways to get help:
 
1. The block description: a short overview of the basic functions of the block.
2. The Help button: opens the documentation page for that block.
