# Intro to Programming with Matlab

- Today's language:
1. For commercial, "shrink-wrapped", large, complex programs: C, C++, Java, C#.
2. To make programming easier and to solve numerical problems: MATLAB

### Matlab as calculator

- You cannot add unit. A number it is just a number. 
- It is ok to use underscore as part of a name.
- Variables are listed in alphabetical order.
- ans: Answer
- Rules for variables name:
1. Can use _
2. UpperCase anywhere (Case senstitive)
3. Can have digits(x45, but not 45x)
4. Have to start with a letter

- Variables declared with ; will no.
- ; can be used to multiple commands in the same line.

### Commands
- save
- clear
- clc
- load

### Syntax & Semantics
- Syntax is a languageâ€™s set of rules for the form of the statements, including, for example, the rule that says you can't use a hash symbol in a variable name.
- As we said, the syntax of a command is its form. The semantics of a command is its meaning.
