# Intro to Programming with Matlab

- Today's language:
1. For commercial, "shrink-wrapped", large, complex programs: C, C++, Java, C#.
2. To make programming easier and to solve numerical problems: MATLAB

## C1_W2
### Matlab as calculator

- You cannot add unit. A number it is just a number. 
- It is ok to use underscore as part of a name.
- Variables are listed in alphabetical order.
- ans: Answer
- Rules for variables name:
1. Can use _
2. UpperCase anywhere (Case senstitive)
3. Can have digits(x45, but not 45x)
4. Have to start with a letter

- Variables declared with ; will no.
- ; can be used to multiple commands in the same line.

### Commands
- save
- clear
- clc
- load

### Syntax & Semantics
- Syntax is a languageâ€™s set of rules for the form of the statements, including, for example, the rule that says you can't use a hash symbol in a variable name.
- As we said, the syntax of a command is its form. The semantics of a command is its meaning.

## C1_W3

### Matrices and Operators 

- Matrices (Plural of matrix) are special kinds of arrays. 
- Array: Any set of numbers arranged in a rectangular pattern. 
- Rows x Columns x Dimensions 
- Higher dimensions are uncommon
- The most common have special names:
1. 2D Array: Matrix
2. 1D Array: Vector

### The Colon Operator 

- Start_value:increment:Not_higher_than
- Operator is a function that's invoked by a symbol
- A function is an operation invoked by the name

### Combining and Transforming Matrices

- Combine matrices to result into a new matrix
- Transform a matrix you already have: Use the transposition operator
- The prime symbol : '. Transposition operator

### Arithmetic 

- Array addition: There are special rules for arithmetic on arrays: 
1. To add two matrix together we have to make sure that they have the same dimensions
- Array multiplication: It is very similar to array addition: Z = X.*Y (Need dot)
- Matrix multiplication: Very different from Array Multiplication: Z = X * Y
1. Do not has the dot
2. Operands must be "compatible": The width of the left operand of the matrix multiplication operator must be equal to the height of the right operand
3. Calculation of each element of Z uses both multiplication AND addition 
- Array division: There are two types of array divison:
1. X./Y(Over)
2. X.\Y(Under)  

## C1_W4

### Introduction to Functions 

- Matlab allows you to create built in function, just like original function
- We create  function by using the Editor(edit command)
- A function has its own private workspace and what happens in that workspace, stays in that workspace
- The function declaration: what the worlds sees
- function [out_arg1, out_arg2, ..] = function_name(in_arg1, in_arg2,..)
- Use meaningful names that tell you something about what your function does
- Do not use names of built-in functions, sqrt, plot, sin..
- Advantages:
- Functions allow you to break down large complex problems to smaller, more maneagable pieces
- Functional decomposition 
- Code reuse
- Generality

- Script is just a collection of MATLAB commands

## C1_W5

### Toolbox

- Built-in functions
- FUNCTION RETURNS 
- zeros(N,M): zeros
- ones(N,M): ones
- eye(N,M): zeros except for the diagonal elements that are ones
- rand(N,M): random numbers uniformly distributed in the range from 0 to 1
- acos(x): Angle in radians whose cosine equals x
- acot(x): Angle in radians whose cotangent equals x
- asin(x): Angle in radians whose sine equals x
- atan(x): Angle in radians whose tangent equals x
- atan2(y,x): Four-quadrant angle in radians whose tangent equals y/x 
- cos(x): Cosine of x (x in radians)
- cot(x): Cotangent of x (x in radians)
- sin(x): Sine of x (x in radians)
- tan(x): Tangent of x (x in radians)
- exp(x): e raised to the x power
- log(x): Natural logarithm x
- log2(x): Base-2 logarithm of x
- log10(x): Base-10 logarithm of x
- sqrt(x): Square root of 
- abs(z): Absolute value of z
- angle(z): Phase angle of z
- conj(z): Complex conjugate of z
- imag(z): Imaginary part of z
- real(z): Real part of z

- Polymorphism: If the type of an input argument to a function can vary from one call to another, it is called a "Polymorphic" function. Polymorphic means "having multiple forms", and it can save us a huge amount of work. 
- Second form of polymorphism: Variation in the number of arguments from a call to call. 
- Many built-in MATLAB functions employ the first of polymorphism by returning an output that is shaped like the input. 

- When we start MATLAB and call rand, it always returns the same exact number: 0.8147

### Debugging

- It is easy to make mistakes
- Syntax errors:
1. Matlab catches these
- Semantic erros:
1. Some may cause erros that MATLAB can catch
2. Some may cause the wrong result every time
3. Some may only cause problems occasionally 

- Matlab has built-in debugger(Tools)

## C1_W6

### Control flow

- Sequential Control: Sequence of commands  excuted one after the other
