# Intro to Programming with Matlab

- Today's language:
1. For commercial, "shrink-wrapped", large, complex programs: C, C++, Java, C#.
2. To make programming easier and to solve numerical problems: MATLAB

## C1_W2
### Matlab as calculator

- You cannot add unit. A number it is just a number. 
- It is ok to use underscore as part of a name.
- Variables are listed in alphabetical order.
- ans: Answer
- Rules for variables name:
1. Can use _
2. UpperCase anywhere (Case senstitive)
3. Can have digits(x45, but not 45x)
4. Have to start with a letter

- Variables declared with ; will no.
- ; can be used to multiple commands in the same line.

### Commands
- save
- clear
- clc
- load

### Syntax & Semantics
- Syntax is a languageâ€™s set of rules for the form of the statements, including, for example, the rule that says you can't use a hash symbol in a variable name.
- As we said, the syntax of a command is its form. The semantics of a command is its meaning.

## C1_W3

### Matrices and Operators 

- Matrices (Plural of matrix) are special kinds of arrays. 
- Array: Any set of numbers arranged in a rectangular pattern. 
- Rows x Columns x Dimensions 
- Higher dimensions are uncommon
- The most common have special names:
1. 2D Array: Matrix
2. 1D Array: Vector

### The Colon Operator 

- Start_value:increment:Not_higher_than
- Operator is a function that's invoked by a symbol
- A function is an operation invoked by the name

### Combining and Transforming Matrices

- Combine matrices to result into a new matrix
- Transform a matrix you already have: Use the transposition operator
- The prime symbol : '. Transposition operator

### Arithmetic 

- Array addition: There are special rules for arithmetic on arrays: 
1. To add two matrix together we have to make sure that they have the same dimensions
- Array multiplication: It is very similar to array addition: Z = X.*Y (Need dot)
- Matrix multiplication: Very different from Array Multiplication: Z = X * Y
1. Do not has the dot
2. Operands must be "compatible": The width of the left operand of the matrix multiplication operator must be equal to the height of the right operand
3. Calculation of each element of Z uses both multiplication AND addition 
- Array division: There are two types of array divison:
1. X./Y(Over)
2. X.\Y(Under)  

## C1_W4

### Introduction to Functions 

- Matlab allows you to create built in function, just like original function
- We create  function by using the Editor(edit command)
- A function has its own private workspace and what happens in that workspace, stays in that workspace
- The function declaration: what the worlds sees
- function [out_arg1, out_arg2, ..] = function_name(in_arg1, in_arg2,..)
- Use meaningful names that tell you something about what your function does
- Do not use names of built-in functions, sqrt, plot, sin..
- Advantages:
- Functions allow you to break down large complex problems to smaller, more maneagable pieces
- Functional decomposition 
- Code reuse
- Generality

- Script is just a collection of MATLAB commands

## C1_W5

### Toolbox

- Built-in functions
- FUNCTION RETURNS 
- zeros(N,M): zeros
- ones(N,M): ones
- eye(N,M): zeros except for the diagonal elements that are ones
- rand(N,M): random numbers uniformly distributed in the range from 0 to 1
- acos(x): Angle in radians whose cosine equals x
- acot(x): Angle in radians whose cotangent equals x
- asin(x): Angle in radians whose sine equals x
- atan(x): Angle in radians whose tangent equals x
- atan2(y,x): Four-quadrant angle in radians whose tangent equals y/x 
- cos(x): Cosine of x (x in radians)
- cot(x): Cotangent of x (x in radians)
- sin(x): Sine of x (x in radians)
- tan(x): Tangent of x (x in radians)
- exp(x): e raised to the x power
- log(x): Natural logarithm x
- log2(x): Base-2 logarithm of x
- log10(x): Base-10 logarithm of x
- sqrt(x): Square root of 
- abs(z): Absolute value of z
- angle(z): Phase angle of z
- conj(z): Complex conjugate of z
- imag(z): Imaginary part of z
- real(z): Real part of z

- Polymorphism: If the type of an input argument to a function can vary from one call to another, it is called a "Polymorphic" function. Polymorphic means "having multiple forms", and it can save us a huge amount of work. 
- Second form of polymorphism: Variation in the number of arguments from a call to call. 
- Many built-in MATLAB functions employ the first of polymorphism by returning an output that is shaped like the input. 

- When we start MATLAB and call rand, it always returns the same exact number: 0.8147

### Debugging

- It is easy to make mistakes
- Syntax errors:
1. Matlab catches these
- Semantic erros:
1. Some may cause erros that MATLAB can catch
2. Some may cause the wrong result every time
3. Some may only cause problems occasionally 

- Matlab has built-in debugger(Tools)

## C1_W6

### Control flow

- Sequential Control: Sequence of commands  excuted one after the other
- Control construct: A method by which MATLAB selects the next command to execute
- Sequential control: default
- Selection or Branching

- IF STATEMENT
- Most common selection construct
- Begins with control statement   
- if keyword followed by a condition
- Ends with 'end' statement
- In between: Statements to be executed if and only if condition is true

- IF ELSE STATEMENT
- Executing a different set of statement based on the condition

- RELATIONAL OPERATORS
- Produces a result that depends on the relation between its two operands
- It can appers outside if-statement
- == : is equal to
- ~= : is not equal to
- <  : is less than
- >  : is greater than
- >= : is greater than or equal to
- <= : is less than or equal to 

- LOGICAL VALUES:
- Non-zero: true
- Zero: false
- MATLAB returns 1 for true

- How to combine logical values ? Logical operators
- && : and
- || : or
- ~  : not

- NESTED IF-STATEMENT 
- If-staements can contain other if-statements

### Variable number of function arguments

- Polymorphic functions: Functions that behave differently based on
- Number of input or output arguments 
- Type of input or output arguments
- Many built-in functions are polymorphic(Size, plot, sqrt)

### Robustness

- A function declaration specifies:
- Name of the function
- Number of input arguments 
- Number of output arguments

- Function code and documentation specify
- What the function does
- The type of the arguments
- What the arguments represent

- Robustness
- A function is robust if it handles erroneous input and output arguments
- Provides a meaningful error message

- Comments
- Extra text that is not part of the code
- Extra information for human reader
- Explain important or complicated parts of the program 
- Provide documentation of your function 

### Persistent Variables

- Variables:
- Local
- Global
- Persistent: It is a local variable, but it is value persist from one call of the function to the next. Relatively rarely used. None of the bad side effects of global variables. None of the bad effects of global variables. 

## C1_W7

- Loop: The loop is a new control construct that makes it possible to repeat a block of code a number of times. 
- MATLAB: Uses loops internally both to compute the result of the colon operator and to compute the sum of the elements
of the vector n above
- Implicit loop

- MATLAB implements FOR-LOOP

- While loop: For loops work well when we know the number of necessary iterations before the loop. 
- Logical Index: 
- Problem: Given a vector, v, of scalars, create a second, w, that contains only the non-negative elements of v.
Solution:

w=[];
jj=0;
for ii=1:length(v); 
  if v(ii) >=0 
    jj = jj+1;
    w(jj) = v(ii);
  end
end

- Matlab provides a more elegant solution
w=[];
for ii=1:length(v); 
  if v(ii) >=0 
  %All elements current in w + v(ii)
    w = [w v(ii)];
  end
end

- The ultimate solution

w = v(v>=0);

- This is an example of logical index

- Prealocation: In no prealoc version, matlab has no ideal how large the matrix a is eventually going to became. 
So every timewe add a new row, it had to find another place in the memory and copy the entire contents of the current array into the new
location before it could add the next element. Find a place in memory and reserving it for a var is calle memory allocation. 
If you prealloc, it will save time for matlab.
- You time a function with the help of two other functions called tick and tock. 

## C1_W8

- Limitations of computers:
1. Real numbers can be infinitly large
2. Have infinitily fine resolition
-Computers: Finite memory
1. Upper limit on the largest number that can be represented 
2. Lower limit on the absolute value of any non-zero number

- A data type is defined by:
1. Set of values
2. Set of operations that can be performed on those values

Double:
- Floating point representation 
- 64 bits (8 bytes)

Single:
- 32-bit floating point 

Integers:
- Signed, unsigned 
- 8, 16, 32, 64 - bit long 

Strings

Text: String
We have used strings already:
- Argument to fprintf and oher functions 

String: vector of char-s
Numerical type
- Uses an encoding scheme 
- Each character ir represented by a number ASCII scheme

Struct
- An array must be homogeneous:
- It cannot contain elements of multiple types 
- A struct can be heterogeneous:
- It can contain multiple types 
- Structs are differentfrom arrays:
1. Fields and not elements
2. Field names, not indices 
3. Fields in the same struct can have different types

- Versatility inside: 
- A field of a struct can contain another struct

Cell
- Pointers: How to store a page of text?
- Each line should be a scheme separate string
- Cannot use an array of chars:
 1. Each line would have to have the same length
 2. A vector of objects with each refering to one line
 
 - Each variable (scalar, vector, array, etc.) is stored in the computer memory
 - Each memory location has a unique address
 - A pointer is a variable that stores an address
 - Matlab calls a pointer a "cell"
 
 - Matlab has a restrictive pointer model 
 1. Stric rules on what can be done with cells
 2. Harder to make mistakes
 - But it is a powerful way to store heterogeneous data
 1. Cell arrays
 2. Used more frequently that structs
 - New syntax 
 1. To access he data a cell point to, use {}

Cell functions 
1. cell: create an array of type cell
2. celldisp: show all the objects pointed at by a cell array
3. cellfun: apply a function to all the objects pointed at by a cell array
4. cellplot: show a graphical depiction of the contents of a cell array
5. cell2atruct: convert a cell array into a struct array
6. dell: copy a value into output arguments 
7. iscell: returns true if argument is of type cell
8. num2cell: convert a numeric array into a cell array

## W9

File I/O
- File:
- Area in permanent storage (disk drive)
- Stores information
- Managed by the operating system
- Can be copied or moved 
- Can be accessed by programs 

- File Input/Output 
- Data exchange between programs and computers 
- Data exchange between the physical world and computers
- Saving your work so you can continue with it later

- Matlab can handle 
- Mat-files and M-files

- Excel Files
- Excel is widely used data-analysis tool
- Many other programs support reading and writing excel files
- Matlab does too with two built-in functions 
1. xlsread
2. xlswrite

- Text file 
- Text file contain characters 
- They use an encoding scheme: ASCII
- before using a text file, we need to open it
- Once done with the file, we need to close it

- Opening text files:
1. Opening: fid=fopen(filename, permission)
2. Closing: fclose(fid)
- File identifier: A handle to refer to the file once open
- Permission: What we want to do with the file: Read, Write, overwrite, append
1. rt: open text file for reading
2. wt: open text file for writing, discard existing contents
3. at: open or create text file for writing, append data end of file
4. r+t: open (do not create) text file for reading and writing 
5. w + t: open or create file for reading and writing, dscard existing contents
6. a + t: Open or create text file for reading and writing; append data to end of file

Reading text files
- One line at a time 
- Type prints a text file in the command window

- Reading lines into string variables is easy
- Parsing these strings to get numerical data is much harder
- Not covered
- Binary files are more suited for numerical data

Binary Files 
- Binary files = "Not a text file"
- Many different ways to represent numbers
- All we need to know are their types
- Binary files need to be 
- Opened with fopen
- Closed with fclose
1. r: Open binary file for reading
2. w: open binary file for writing, discard existing contents
3. a: open or create binary file writing, append data to end of file
4. r+: open(do not create) binary file for reading and writing 
5. w+: open or create binary file for reading and writing, discard existing contents
6. a+: Open or create binary file for reading and writing; append data to end of file

# Mastering Programming with MATLAB 

## W1
- Recursionis having a function calling himself
- Most commong case if Factorial 
- Every recursive implementation has an iterative version
- Iterative is almost always faster than recursive 
- But often the recursive version is easier to implement 

## W2 

- Function handles and nested functions:
- Call a function through a variable: Function handles
- A normal function is a function name and can have any number of statements in it body.
- An anonymous functions has no name, and it can have only one statement in its body. Also, if you wanto to have multiple outputs from an anonymous func, its one executable statement has to be a call to a function that already returns multiple outputs. 
- Nested function: It's similar to a sub-function in that it lives in an M-file with a main function, just like a su-function does. However, a nested function is actually defined inside the body of another function, also called its parent function. Makes easier to pass information back and forth functions.
